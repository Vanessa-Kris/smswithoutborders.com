## Rendering Markdown Files

The [Privacy Policy](http://localhost:18000/privacy-policy) page is loaded from the [privacy-policy](./privacy-policy/) folder as markdown into the website. Check [CONFIGURATIONS.md](CONFIGURATIONS.md) on how to setup the file path.

The website then determines which file to load based on the currently selected locale.

```js
 /path_to_privacy_policy_files/{locale}.md
```

## Synchronization

Authenticated users can synchronize their accounts with the mobile app from the [Synchronization](https://localhost:18000/dashboard/sync) page. This process ensures users can communicate securely over sms through the app.

The sync page uses a background socket connection to enable handshakes. The intial request to obtain the connection url returns a JSON object with two keys

```JSON
{
 "qr_url": "",
 "mobile_url": "",
}
```
